# Project Overview:
“Coin Flip” is a betting game in the Solidity language using the Harmony testnet and Harmony VRF (Verifiable Random Function).
A user can bet on the particular outcome (0 for heads and 1 for tails) of coin flip. The program excepts bet choice and bet amount from user. Winners will get double the price of bet amount.
